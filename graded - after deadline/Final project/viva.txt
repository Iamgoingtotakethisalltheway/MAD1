> He asked me about the responsive design used in my app. How it works? (I told about bootstrap containers, grid system, css media queries it uses etc)
> Model used - Explain the code. Show code and also the data in sqlite db.
> Password hashing - Have you done? What hashing method have you used?
> HTTP vs HTTPS - What are they and what is the difference?
> Template inheritance - Have you used it and how? Show it in code.
